# ToolBox
tool inventory manager 
personal project for python study - building on known apps mytoolbox etc. 
working code on a small scale inventory to manage limited tool database and 
employee database so - employee can pull and return tools from inventory and 
system can know where each tool is and the condition of said tool at any given time

This will need to be a mobile app, or rather already is - lots done already on the market
People on job site or at home can check tools in and out of the inventory or company's main toolbox
physical location of tools will either be in central physical tool inventory on site or company location or in posession of the
employee that checks the tool out of the box
